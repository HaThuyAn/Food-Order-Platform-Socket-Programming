# Food-Order Platform
This project is the result of the course "Computer Networking" where we were assigned in groups of 2 within exactly 4 weeks to create a platform that allows users (or clients) to set up connections to the server side to order food.
This app is MFC-based and was built using Visual Studio 2022. All functions related to the database were supported by Microsoft Access.
