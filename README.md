# Food-Order Platform
This project is the result of the course "Computer Networks" where we were allowed to work in a group of 2 within exactly 4 weeks to create a platform that allows users (or clients) to set up connections to the server side to order food.
This app is MFC-based and was coded up using Visual Studio 2022.
